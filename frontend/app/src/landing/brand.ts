// Lives here rather than under landing/protocol/ because landing/components/

// Brand architecture: Republika Network (ecosystem) -> Soberanía Protocol
// (open protocol layer) -> Frontera Systems (commercial systems layer, which
// operationalizes Protocol capabilities) -> centers of gravity. Frontera
// Systems replaced the retired "Soberanía Enterprise" product brand, and it
// lives on its own site rather than behind the in-app `?view=enterprise`
// route, so every visible reference to it points out of this origin.
//
// Internal identifiers (EnterpriseId, enterpriseNodes, `layer="enterprise"`,
// the landing/enterprise directory, …) intentionally keep the old term as
// implementation terminology; only the public brand moved.
// The canonical public origin of the Soberanía Protocol site. Apex, not www:
// no deployment config in this repository establishes a www convention
// (frontend/app/vercel.json carries only the SPA rewrite, and there is no
// CNAME / redirect / domain configuration anywhere), so the apex host is the
// canonical one. Supersedes the retired www.aocprotocol.org origin.
// Static public assets (index.html, robots.txt, sitemap.xml) necessarily
// repeat this value literally — they cannot import it.
